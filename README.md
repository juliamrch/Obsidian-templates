# Obsidian French Templates

Those are my templates for everyday work and projects, self hosted on my computer with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

## What kind of templates are those ?

Sometimes, I translate to French some existing templates that I find cool and create my own. Templates I reuse are in a separate folder with appropriate README and LICENCE files.

Most of the time, I create my own. You can use these models to start working with [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) and create your own if you wish.

Some are business oriented, others might be more creative oriented. It really depends on the mood or if Mercury is in retrograde. For example.

### Notes

For daily and weekly logs. Categories from `note-quotidienne` are automatically reported to `revue-hebdo` to create a summary. Add `note-quotidienne` as your default template for the Daily Note.

### Projet

Templates to keep track of your projects and acomplishment. Use `Projet` as a template to write your project details. The #wip tag will add it to `tableau-de-bord` and remove it when you change it to #done. Once you change the #wip tag to #done, your project will appear in your `🚀 Accomplissements` dashboard. 

### Réunions

These are templates for different kinds of meeting. I've connected it to my embeded calendar to create a note before a meeting.

### Blog

This is a template post for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), since I use Obsidian to write my posts.


## Special features?

Most templates require [DataView](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin, which you can install easiyly from the Obsidian app interface. Globally, I hightly recommend installing this very cool plugin and supporting the creator with donations.

That's it, enjoy.

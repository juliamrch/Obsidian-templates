# Obsidian French Templates

Those are my templates for everyday work and projects, self hosted on my computer with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

## What kind of templates are those ?

I translate to French some existing templates that I find cool and create my own. Template I reuse are in a separate folder with appropriate README and LICENCE files. 

Some are business oriented, others might be more creative oriented. It really depends on the mood or if Mercury is in retrograde. For example.

## Special features?

Some templates might require the [DataView](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin, which you can install easiyly from the Obsidian app interface. Globally, I hightly recommend installing this very cool plugin and supporting the creator with donations.

That's it, enjoy.
